          <strong>App Inventor Project</strong>
          <h2>Soccer Simulator</h2>
          <h5>This Project was made in Computer Science Principles 10/6/18</h5>

          <p>This was my first project using App Inventor. My partner and I
          worked hard to make a two-player soccer game, where both players go
          head-to-head and try to score on each other. The game was going well
          until we found out that App Inventor does not allow 2 finger touch
          screen support, so the idea of making a two-player game was gone. 
          
          <p>We learned that you have to be patient with technology, expecially
          with a software that you never really used before. I also got better
          at asking for help from other groups, usually I try to work
          independently but there were a lot of bugs/glitches we ran into which
          we could not solve on our own. </p>
