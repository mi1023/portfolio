          <strong>App Inventor Project</strong>
          <h2>Soccer Simulator</h2>

          <p>This was my first project using App Inventor. My partner and I
          worked hard to make a two-player soccer game, where both players go
          head-to-head and try to score on each other. The game was going well
          until we found out that App Inventor does not allow 2 finger touch
          screen support, so the idea of making a two-player game was gone. 
          
          <p>We learned that you have to be patient with technology, expecially
          with a software that you never really used before. I also got better
          at asking for help from other groups, usually I try to work
          independently but there were a lot of bugs/glitches we ran into which
          we could not solve on our own. </p>

          <strong>Image Manipulation Project</strong>
          <h2>Family Photographers</h2>
          <h5>This Project was made in Computer Science Principles 3/20/19</h5>
          <img src='familyphoto1.PNG' style='max-width:300px' class='float-right' >
          <p>This project was the most challenging this year because me and my
          partner underestimated how much time we would need to actually 
          complete the project. Because of this, we did not work as efficiently
          the first week.
          
          <p>From this project I learned that I should manage my time better
             even if I have enough time to mess around. But I think me and my
             partner did very well for the amount of time we had left to work.
             And even though it was hard for me to complete this project I still
             really enjoyed it becuase it taught me to mange my time like I said
             before.</p>
